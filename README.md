### Instantiate `BankIdClient` Class

`BankIdClient` provides functionality to initiate authentication or signing order, collect order result or cancel the order.

Instantiate for `BankIdClient` for test environment.
```
>>> from bankid6 import BankIdClient
>>> bankid_client = BankIdClient()
```
This instance will use BankID test url, test certificates which are provided in the package. It's configured for computers. It can be initialized for mobile devices which helps to render correct message and correct url for launching the app.
```
>>> bankid_client = BankIdClient(is_mobile=True)            # Default to False
```
<br/>

To initialize for a production environment, ensure that the `prod_env` parameter is set to `True`. Additionally, you must provide the file paths for the certificate, the private key associated with the certificate, and the CA certificate.
```
>>> bankid_client = BankIdClient(prod_env=True, cert_pem=<certificate_filepath>, key_pem='<private_key_filepath>', ca_pem=<ca_certificate_filepath>)
```
<br/>

### Initiate Authentication or Signing Order

The `BankIdClient` offers `auth` and `sign` methods to initiate authentication and signing orders, respectively. These methods return a `BankIdStartResponse` object, which contains attributes to easily get the data for QR code and url for launching the BankID app.

```
>>> bankid_client = BankIdClient()
>>> start_response = bankid_client.auth('192.168.0.1')      # Takes IP of end user

>>> start_response.qr_data                                  # Calculated data to create QR code
'bankid.c03da000-d5de-4435-b81b-66154960784d.8.7a7f4a36307cb8d8ddb4fe86116764819def4c32c55d1ba792e6e4117be9a5a1'

>>> start_response.launch_url()                             # Depends on is_mobile parameter of the BankIdClient
'bankid:///?autostarttoken=aaba5bef-1066-42da-b6c6-0730b8c53997&redirect=null'

>>> start_response.launch_url('https://www.google.com')     # Takes a redirect url as parameter
'bankid:///?autostarttoken=aaba5bef-1066-42da-b6c6-0730b8c53997&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com'

>>> [attr for attr in dir(start_response) if not attr.startswith('_')]
['autoStartToken', 'data', 'launch_url', 'orderRef', 'order_time', 'qrStartSecret', 'qrStartToken', 'qr_data', 'response', 'status_code', 'url']
```

Subsequent QR data can be found in response of `collect` method or from `generate_qr_data` function.
```
>>> from bankid6 import generate_qr_data
>>> generate_qr_data(start_response.order_time, start_response.qrStartToken, start_response.qrStartSecret)
'bankid.c03da000-d5de-4435-b81b-66154960784d.250.16f0f42bb4f1a99d41a31e38cd54866fce5a193e277f4d48339a7579ac51fe4e'
```
<br>

The `BankIdClient` also has `phone_auth` and `phone_sign` methods initiate authentication and signing orders while the customer is on the phone. You need to pass a personal number and the BankID will send the request to the customer's BankID app. These methods return a `BankIdPhoneStartResponse` object.
```
>>> phone_start_response = BankIdClient().phone_auth('199002113166', callInitiator="RP")
>>> [attr for attr in dir(phone_start_response) if not attr.startswith('_')]
['data', 'orderRef', 'response', 'status_code', 'url']
```

Both `sign` and `phone_sign` methods require `userVisibleData` parameter.
```
>>> BankIdClient().sign('192.168.0.1', userVisibleData="Hello! Sign this test documents")
<class 'bankid6.handlers.BankIdStartResponse'> response status: 200;
response data: {"orderRef": "6eaf4368-22ae-4309-8768-f58b772d1617", "autoStartToken": "3d973332-8abe-4273-b292-b16c975a1a39", "qrStartToken": "29d0b198-487d-42b8-91a8-c63fc94a2733", "qrStartSecret": "a611ccd5-5940-4160-9fde-20a251716bfb"}
```

These methods have required or optional parameters exactly as described in BankID documentation. These parameters are validated, processed as BankID requires and sent as the data of the request to the BankID.

The returned objects are derived from `BankIdBaseResponse`, parses any BankID response, creating an attribute with the same name as the key of the response data. `BankIdBaseResponse` has attributes related to actual HTTP response. This is also True for `collect` or `cancel`.

See the API Reference section for comprehensive documentation detailing parameters and return values.
<br/>

### Collect Order Result

Use `collect` method of `BankIdClient` object to get the order result.
```
>>> from bankid6 import BankIdClient
>>> bankid_client = BankIdClient()

>>> bankid_client.auth('192.168.0.1')
<class 'bankid6.handlers.BankIdStartResponse'> response status: 200
response data: {"orderRef": "ccc9b028-4c83-49f8-b5ae-a3bac54a7427", "autoStartToken": "96c45dea-d14c-4bc5-bf30-db4015d39da9", "qrStartToken": "d550a68e-1e4d-4d66-8dce-3c6497c8da73", "qrStartSecret": "4b3bba21-ebaa-4bf4-8856-e66271550b78"}

>>> bankid_client.collect()
<class 'bankid6.handlers.BankIdCollectResponse'> response status: 200;
response data: {"orderRef": "ccc9b028-4c83-49f8-b5ae-a3bac54a7427", "status": "pending", "hintCode": "outstandingTransaction"}
```

It returns `BankIdCollectResponse` which is derived from `BankIdBaseResponse` class.
```
>>> collect_response = bankid_client.collect()
>>> collect_response.status                             # BankID status from response data
'pending'
>>> collect_response.qr_data                            # calculates qr data according to the time             
'bankid.d9c9339c-b9d3-48a2-8289-8d66e1d28a08.21.941023af5b86d5b16aaa226ad7130ee08a1dcdca89e199639a3986336a0569fb'
>>> from bankid6 import CollectStatuses
>>> collect_response.status == CollectStatuses.pending  # don't have to remember status values
True
```

Like the BankID documentation, the response object provides information in `completionData` (object of `BankIdCompletionData`) attribute when status is "complete".

```
>>> cr = bankid_client.collect()
>>> print(cr.completionData.user.personalNumber) if cr.status == CollectStatuses.complete else print(cr.hintCode)
```

It's possible to decouple the collect method from order initiating methods.

```
>>> sr = BankIdClient().auth('192.168.0.1')
>>> cr = BankIdClient().collect(orderRef=sr.orderRef, qrStartToken=sr.qrStartToken, qrStartSecret=sr.qrStartSecret, order_time=sr.order_time)
>>> cr.qr_data
'bankid.d9c9339c-b9d3-48a2-8289-8d66e1d28a08.21.941023af5b86d5b16aaa226ad7130ee08a1dcdca89e199639a3986336a0569fb'
```
`orderRef` parameter is used to find the order and `qrStartToken`, `qrStartSecret` and `order_time` parameters are used to calculate the QR code. `qr_data` attribute in `BankIdCollectResponse` object is accessible if the `collect` method is invoked from the same client where order was initiated, or if these parameters are provided.

#### User Message

`BankIdCollectResponse` also has `message` attribute which contains user message according to BankID documentation when the status is 'pending' or 'failed'. A message depends on how order was initiated and the language. Each message is a dict constructed like this:
```python
{
    "qrcode": {             # order initiated by scanning qr code
        "swedish": "",
        "english": ""
    },
    "onfile": {             # order initiated by starting the bankid app on the same device
        "swedish": "",
        "english": ""
    }
} 
```

`UseTypes` and `Languages` classes can be used to extract the correct message easily.

```
>>> cr = bankid_client.collect()
>>> from bankid6 import UseTypes, Languages
>>> print(cr.message[UseTypes.qrcode][Languages.en]) if cr.status in [CollectStatuses.complete, CollectStatuses.failed]
'Start your BankID app.'
```

You can make a subclass of `Messages`, override it's existing messages and pass it to`BankIdClient` as a parameter. Any message in `Messages` class is a attribute which starts with 'RFA' as in BankID documentation.
```python
from bankid6 import Messages

print(Messages.RFA1.help_text) # prints 'status=pending, hintCode=outstandingTransaction, hintCode=noClient'

class MyMessage(Messages):
    RFA1 = {'test': 'yes'}
    RFA13 = ('<h3>swedish message<h3>', '<h3>english message</h3>')

bankid_client = BankIdClient(messages=MyMessage)
```
Their value can be a dict or a tuple of swedish and english messages. If the value is dict, it is returned as it is from `message` attribute of `BankIdCollectResponse` object.
<br/>

### Cancel Order
Use `cancel` mothod of `BankIdClient` object to cancel the order.
```
>>> bankid_client = BankIdClient()

>>> bankid_client.auth('192.168.0.1')
<class 'bankid6.handlers.BankIdStartResponse'> response status: 200
response data: {"orderRef": "ccc9b028-4c83-49f8-b5ae-a3bac54a7427", "autoStartToken": "96c45dea-d14c-4bc5-bf30-db4015d39da9", "qrStartToken": "d550a68e-1e4d-4d66-8dce-3c6497c8da73", "qrStartSecret": "4b3bba21-ebaa-4bf4-8856-e66271550b78"}

>>> bankid_client.cancel()
<class 'bankid6.handlers.BankIdCancelResponse'> response status: 200;
response data: {}
```

This can be decouple by using it's `orderRef` parameter.

```
>>> start_response = BankIdClient().auth('192.168.0.1')
>>> BankIdClient().auth(orderRef=start_response.orderRef)
<class 'bankid6.handlers.BankIdCancelResponse'> response status: 200;
response data: {}
```
<br/>

### Exceptions

All methods in `BankIdClient` can raise `BankIdError` or `BankIdValidationError`. 

`BankIdError` is raised when a request is made to BankID server and it returned an error. It has `message` attribute with structure like:
```json
{
    "swedish": "",
    "english": ""
}
```
If the message is available, it indicates that the message should be presented to the customer without any additional action required. Otherwise, the `reason` and `action` attributes can provide information on why the error occurred and what steps need to be taken to address it according to BankID documentation. Attribute `response_data` has the data received from bankid in dict format. See Api Reference section for more functionalities.


`BankIdValidationError` is raised before sending the request to BankID if any parameter is invalid.
